# AngularDictate

AngularDictate is an object-relational mapper (ORM) based on [Doctrine Project](http://www.doctrine-project.org/) for [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) applications that provides transparent persistence for Javascript objects. It uses the Data Mapper pattern at the heart, aiming for a complete separation of your domain/business logic from the persistence in the LocalStorage.

The benefit of AngularDictate for the programmer is the ability to focus on the object-oriented business logic and worry about persistence only as a secondary problem. This doesnâ€™t mean persistence is downplayed by AngularDictate, however it is our belief that there are considerable benefits for object-oriented programming if persistence and entities are kept separated.

## Documentation

+ Check the [documentation](https://github.com/softilabs/angular-dictate/blob/master/doc/current.md)


## Quick start

+ Install AngularDictate with [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Bower](https://github.com/bower/bower).

>
```bash
$ npm install -g bower gulp
$ bower install angular-dictate --save
```

+ Include the required libraries in your `index.html`:

>
``` html
<script src="bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/angular-local-storage/dist/angular-local-storage.min.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/angular-dictate/dist/angular-dictate.min.js"></script>
```

+ Inject the `softilabs.ngDictate` module into your app and set the mapping:

>
``` js
angular
    .module('myApp', [
        'myApp.myCtrl',
        'softilabs.ngDictate'
    ])
    .config(function ($dictateProvider) {
        $dictateProvider.setMapping({
            address: {},
            company: {
                hasOne: ['address'],
                hasMany: ['persons'],
                cascade: {
                    all: ['address']
                }
            },
            person: {
                hasOne: ['address'],
                hasOne: ['company'],
                cascade: {
                    all: ['address'],
                    persist: ['company']
                }
            }
        });
    });
```

+ Obtain the entity manager in a controller:

>
``` js
angular
    .module('myApp.myCtrl', [])
    .controller('MyCtrl', function ($dictate) {
        var em = $dictate.getManager();
    });
```

+ Read the documentation.
